--------LAYOUT OF SOLIDITY------
we are trying these codes on Remix IDE.
we have different type of comments ;
single line commenets //
multiline comments /*-----*/
we have anothe type of comment know as "netspec", declared using "///" or "/**-----*/ they can be used just above any function to decribe 
the functionality.
// in this program we are simply calculating the area and parameter of rectangle. we are passing the argument to the function and getting 
the result of it. But in this case we are not using the function modifier as "public" so it will not show the results derectly on the run 
screen. to check out the details of result we have to click on to the "details" bbutton on the remix transaction, script screen 
contract calculator {
    uint public s; // used to display result on run screen
    uint public p;
    //function rectangle (uint h, uint w) returns (uint s, uint p) {
      function rectangle (uint h, uint w) {
      s= h*w;
      p =2*(w+h);
     
     
    }
}
