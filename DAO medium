 is it possible to run an organization which only consist codes and totally decentalized 
 in nature? its sounds impossible, OK fine now lets talk about our traditional centralized 
 system it follows a hieracical structure to mange the work flow there is CEO, than top level
 managers, lower level manager and than employess we follow the same sturcture to setup a 
 company or a startup. 
 take a pause and think, analyse the sturture carefully its nothing but a group of people having
 certain contracts between each other who has allowed what they have to do who has 
 which wides and permission. Centralized system has some flaws when there is a single point of
 failure it comes to curroption or if people makes mistake it has large influation on
 oragnization its include paper work, meetings and lots of thing we have to wriitten down.
 we need something that records the rule, bylaws of a company, no centralized authority,
 no server,
 where we can transfer money and gadget, it actutually turns out and all these things exist 
 called Blockchain Technology. the first thing that comes into our mind when we talk about 
 Blockchain is "Bitcoin" but it was the first usecase introcuded by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 to 
 build decentralized cryptocurrency and trying to make decentralized money which was a uage step
 toward decentalization but there exist other technology called "Ethereum" which took one step
 further. it added some possiblity to write Smart Contracts. smart contract is a computer code 
  build on top of cryptocurrenty blockchain network where computers or nodes executes the code.
  once the node execute this contract they update the ledger.
  blockchain is a technology that automate trust and the automated frictionless value change
  this capacity to automate the basic working of the social institution coupled with increased 
  connectivity. 
  the decentralized autonomos organization is run by rules that are created by there members through
  a consenses process and written into a set of contracts that are run by a set of computer code on
  blockchain thus enabling the automated managment of a distributed organization. it is a online 
  platform comunities with the resources organized according to the rules agreed in advance 
  and set out into its code that enables the modification of code through member consenses. it is currently
  possible by the devlopment of ethereum. etherum is a public blockchain  
  which work as decentralized virtual machine for exectuting peer to peer contracts. DAO are assentailly 
  complex smart contract that combine to form a set of rule that manages the set of operation of a 
  group of members and there resources. distributed organization are designed to support self sustening
  system of organization through local feedback loops. in self organization, instead of having formal managment system 
  there is monitoring and cordinating the organization from a central point. decentralized system 
  work though a signalling system whch are distributed feedback loops , to tackle a problemm by creating
   a infrastructure of corporation done through local interaction between member and signalling 
   system that are designed to create a self organizing system. good example of buying things 
   online one these day it includes feedback system provided by buyer-seller, that contain peer to peer
   interaction
