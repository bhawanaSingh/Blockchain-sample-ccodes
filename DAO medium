 is it possible to run an organization which only consist codes and totally decentalized 
 in nature? its sounds impossible, OK fine now lets talk about our traditional centralized 
 system it follows a hieracical structure to mange the work flow there is CEO, than top level
 managers, lower level manager and than employess we follow the same sturcture to setup a 
 company or a startup. 
 take a pause and think, analyse the sturture carefully its nothing but a group of people having
 certain contracts between each other who has allowed what they have to do who has 
 which wides and permission. Centralized system has some flaws when there is a single point of
 failure it comes to curroption or if people makes mistake it has large influation on
 oragnization its include paper work, meetings and lots of thing we have to wriitten down.
 we need something that records the rule, bylaws of a company, no centralized authority,
 no server,
 where we can transfer money and gadget, it actutually turns out and all these things exist 
 called Blockchain Technology. the first thing that comes into our mind when we talk about 
 Blockchain is "Bitcoin" but it was the first usecase introcuded by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 to 
 build decentralized cryptocurrency and trying to make decentralized money which was a uage step
 toward decentalization but there exist other technology called "Ethereum" which took one step
 further. it added some possiblity to write Smart Contracts. smart contract is a computer code 
  build on top of cryptocurrenty blockchain network where computers or nodes executes the code.
  once the node execute this contract they update the ledger.
  blockchain is a technology that automate trust and the automated frictionless value change
  this capacity to automate the basic working of the social institution coupled with increased 
  connectivity.
